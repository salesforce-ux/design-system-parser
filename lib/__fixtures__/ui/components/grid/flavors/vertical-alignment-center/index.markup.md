To vertically center align a single row or multi-line rows to the height of a grid container, apply the class `.slds-grid--vertical-align-center`. Note, to vertically align elements on a cross-axis of a `.slds-grid`, the elements need available vertical white space. This is usually achieved by having a height applied to the `.slds-grid`.

When `.slds-grid--vertical-align-center` is used in conjunction with `.slds-grid--align-center`, the outcome would horizontally and vertically center align your content in the center of the `.slds-grid`.
