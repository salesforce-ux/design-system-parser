Flexbox grids &mdash; equal width &mdash; left aligned &mdash; columns that stretch/shrink.

If there are too few columns, there will be a space on the right.
If there are more columns than can fit in the given space, you will be able to scroll horizontally.

Parent container is **required** to have the helper class `.slds-scrollable-x`. The grid rows require the helper class `.slds-grid--overflow` and a parent level sizing helper class which will provide out of the box values for min- and max-widths.
